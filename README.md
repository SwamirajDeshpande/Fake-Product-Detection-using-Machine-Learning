# üö´ Fake Product Detection using Machine Learning
## üìù Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution to automatically detect counterfeit or fake products by analyzing relevant product data, including a crucial step for on-the-spot physical verification.

The system utilizes machine learning algorithms for classification to distinguish between genuine and fake products based on a set of extracted features. It incorporates Computer Vision to enable real-world product authentication via QR codes.

## ‚ú® Features
Computer Vision Integration: Uses OpenCV to detect and decode QR codes on product packaging, which are often used to verify a product's unique identifier against a secure database.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data (e.g., product images, descriptions, manufacturing details) for model training.

Feature Engineering: Extraction of relevant features, potentially including image features (using a CNN), textual features (using NLP techniques), or numerical/categorical metadata.

Model Training & Evaluation: Training multiple classification models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or a Deep Learning model like CNN) and evaluating their performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Prediction Pipeline: A mechanism to input new product data (or a QR code scan) and receive an authenticity prediction (Genuine/Fake).
